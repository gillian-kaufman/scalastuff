// HOMEWORK 6 

// dataset for this homework is customer-orders.csv

//in this homework, we will use sql function in the dataset to
//compute the total amount spent per customer in the e-commerce data

//declare case class called CustomerOrders
//case class defines schema of dataset
//each field of case class defines column name and column type of the dataset
 

// Create schema using StructType object  when reading customer-orders.csv
// since this file does not have header line
    

// Load up the data into spark dataset
// Use default separator (,), load schema from customerOrdersSchema and
// force case class to read it as dataset
    

//we will group by customer id and calculate total spent per customer id
//hint sum() can be used to add things up
//agg(round(sum(...),2) sums and rounds the result
   

//sort by total_spent
    

//show the complete results
